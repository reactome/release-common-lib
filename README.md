# release-common-lib

Code that is common to many parts of the Release process (Java).

If using v1.2.0 and up, this library is available from Maven Central:

https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.reactome.release/release-common-lib
https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.reactome.release/release-common-lib

If using an earlier version you will need to have this library installed in your maven cache before running any other Release steps. Install it like this:

```
$ cd release-common-lib
$ mvn clean install
```
